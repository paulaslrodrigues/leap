Tecgraf Institute, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
● Managed a team of 7-9 developers.  Used Scrum methodology to prioritize tasks and consistently deliver releases.
● Gathered requirements from stakeholders, researched stakeholder needs and processes to suggest improvements that increased speed and efficiency
● Planned and prioritized features for an in-house 3D seismic visualization software for geophysicists, geologists, and petroleum engineers
● Created 2-D well drilling application that allowed users to analyze seismic data that increased the odds of successful drilling and analyzed data in real-time to allow users to adjust drilling as needed
● Designed automated process for 3-D seismic data that reduced turnaround time from 2-3 day to a few minutes by moving algorithms from CPU to GPU
● Proposed and supervised the implementation of a machine learning algorithm that inferred probability of new wells using data from existing wells and automated analysis of research
● Developed and managed a program to process over 1000 Tb data,  cross-plotting seismic volume and well data 
● Created application that analyzed geophysical layers and created 2-D and 3-D visual lithology models
● Real time drilling and cross plot products contributed to significant increase in overall users
● Interviewed and contributed to hiring decision of new team members
● Trained geologists, geophysicists and engineers in use of new features
● Acted as chief product owner for Scrum teams.  Taught other POs how to effectively communicate with stakeholders and how to manage and prioritize product backlog</p>

Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
● Developed a multi platform (Windows and Linux) real time 2-D talking head system 
● Integrated the existing systems Festival, MBROLA and Responsive Face to build an animation system with synchronized speech and facial expressions
● Extended HTML language to incorporate parameters such as language, gender, and mood with a corresponding parser 
● Built a viseme database for the 2-D talking head mesh exploring the four main muscles responsible for the facial expression
● Created a flexible math model to work with primary and secondary emotions from a revision and generalization of Plutchik wheel of emotions
● Defined MPEG-4 FAPs (Facial Animation Parameters) to represent visemes and facial expressions
● Implemented a tool integrating the emotion model with the Baldisync speech recognition module
● Developed eye movements to synchronize with emotions and speech 
● Integrated the facial animation tool with a narrative storytelling system (interoperability between different systems and APIs with speech, facial animation and rendered scenes in real time)
● Developed interactive applications for the middleware Ginga of the Brazilian Digital TV System using the facial animation tool as a player</p>
